## Installation

Once released, you can install the released version of ps from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ps")
```

## Listing all processes

`ps_pids()` returns all process ids on the system. This can be useful to
iterate over all processes.

```{r}
library(ps)
ps_pids()[1:20]
```

`ps()` is similar, but it returns a data frame (tibble if you have the
tibble package available), with data about each process:

```{r}
ps()
```

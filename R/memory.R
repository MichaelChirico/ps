#' Statistics about system memory usage
#'
#' @return List with entries. All numbers are in bytes:
#' * `total`: total physical memory (exclusive swap).
#' * `avail` the memory that can be given instantly to processes without
#'   the system going into swap. This is calculated by summing different
#'   memory values depending on the platform and it is supposed to be used
#'   to monitor actual memory usage in a cross platform fashion.
#' * `percent`: Percentage of memory that is taken.
#' * `used`: memory used, calculated differently depending on
#'   the platform and designed for informational purposes only.
#'   `total` - `free` does not necessarily match `used`.
#' * `free`: memory not being used at all (zeroed) that is
#'   readily available; note that this doesnâ€™t reflect the actual memory
#'   available (use `available` instead). `total` - `used` does not
#'   necessarily match `free`.
#' * `active`: (Unix only) memory currently in use or very recently used,
#'   and so it is in RAM.
#' * `inactive`: (Unix only) memory that is marked as not used.
#' * `wired`: (macOS only) memory that is marked to always stay in RAM. It
#'   is never moved to disk.
